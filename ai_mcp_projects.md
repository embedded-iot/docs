## MCP Implementation Strategies

### Setting Up MCP Servers
```javascript
// Example MCP server for database access
import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server';
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio';

const server = new Server({
  name: 'database-mcp-server',
  version: '1.0.0',
}, {
  capabilities: {
    resources: {},
    tools: {},
  },
});

// Register database access tools
server.setRequestHandler('tools/list', async () => {
  return {
    tools: [
      {
        name: 'query_customer_data',
        description: 'Query customer information from database',
        inputSchema: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            customerId: { type: 'string' },
            fields: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  };
});

// Handle tool calls
server.setRequestHandler('tools/call', async (request) => {
  const { name, arguments: args } = request.params;
  
  if (name === 'query_customer_data') {
    // Secure database query with proper validation
    const result = await queryCustomerData(args.customerId, args.fields);
    return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(result) }] };
  }
});
```
