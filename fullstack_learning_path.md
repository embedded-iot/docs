- Authentication middleware
- Authorization vs Authentication
- Security best practices (CORS, rate limiting)

**Practice Tasks:**
- Implement user registration and login
- Create JWT token generation and verification
- Add protected routes
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add security middleware

**Deliverable:** Secure API with complete authentication flow

### Phase 2: Frontend Development (Weeks 4-6)

#### Week 4: Frontend Setup & Basics
**Technologies:**
- HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript OR
- React.js (recommended for modern development)

**Topics to Learn:**
- Frontend project structure
- HTTP client (fetch API or axios)
- State management
- Form handling and validation

**Practice Tasks:**
- Create login/register forms
- Implement client-side form validation
- Set up API communication
- Create basic UI components

**Deliverable:** Authentication frontend with login/register

#### Week 5: Main Application UI
**Topics to Learn:**
- Component architecture
- Responsive design
- CSS frameworks (Bootstrap/Tailwind)
- Local storage for tokens

**Practice Tasks:**
- Build task dashboard
- Create task CRUD interface
- Implement user profile management
- Add responsive design
- Handle authentication state

**Deliverable:** Complete frontend application

#### Week 6: Advanced Features
**Topics to Learn:**
- Real-time updates (WebSockets/Socket.io)
- File uploads
- Client-side routing
- Error handling and loading states

**Practice Tasks:**
- Add real-time task updates
- Implement file attachments for tasks
- Create loading and error states
- Add search and filtering

**Deliverable:** Feature-complete application

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Weeks 7-8)

#### Week 7: Testing & Quality
**Topics to Learn:**
- Unit testing (Jest)
- Integration testing
- API testing (Supertest)
- Code quality (ESLint, Prettier)

**Practice Tasks:**
- Write unit tests for backend functions
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Add frontend component tests
- Set up automated testing

#### Week 8: Deployment & DevOps
**Topics to Learn:**
- Docker containerization
- Cloud deployment (Heroku, Vercel, AWS)
- Environment management
- CI/CD basics

**Practice Tasks:**
- Dockerize the application
- Deploy backend and frontend
- Set up production database
- Configure environment variables
